              <p class="paper_abstract">Driving is a very challenging task to automatize despite how naturally and efficiently it may come to experienced human drivers. The complexity stems from the need to (i) understand the surrounding context and forecast how it is likely to evolve, (ii) plan motions so that maneuvers can be performed with a certain level of anticipation despite the uncertainty of the future traffic state, and (iii) act on the throttle and the steering wheel to execute the planned motions accurately. These tasks match the major research topics concerning autonomous driving, namely perception and prediction, motion planning, and control. In this thesis, we study challenges related to motion planning and decision-making for connected automated vehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic. That is for CAVs that coexist with human drivers, other CAVs, and unconnected automated vehicles (AVs). Even though we intend to formulate the proposed methods so that they are context agnostic, their assessment is carried out in roundabout scenarios. Roundabouts are ideal testing scenarios due to the complexity of the traffic interaction and overall traffic dynamics, the impact that uncertainty has on the coordination performance, as well as the strong influence that dynamic occlusions of the surroundings caused by nearby vehicles have on the decision-making process. We propose a novel approach concerning how an AV's surrounding space is represented and described, which brings benefits to the motion planning module. Unlike the classical planning approach based on object detection and avoidance, we study an alternative strategy based on free space identification and exploitation, which is shown to be a suitable mechanism to account for occlusions and other perception uncertainties. Our planning solutions are model-based and--inspired on the way human drivers seem to make decisions--aim to make safe yet efficient decisions without the need to explicitly explore all possible trajectories that can be followed. Instead, we propose a low-dimensional driving maneuver representation that enables us to characterize the solution-space of the decision-making problem at a high-level. In particular, a novel planning framework is presented in this thesis to address four significant planning aspects. Firstly, a reactive gap-acceptance behavior is formulated, which represents an appropriate baseline behavior despite its simplicity. Afterward, we investigate a decision-making approach for CAVs in fully connected scenarios, whereby CAVs would consider the impact of their decisions on the overall traffic before executing them. Then, we address the challenge of making AVs cooperate with other unconnected vehicles through a so-called implicitly cooperative mechanism. Furthermore, we present a predictive-reactive planning strategy where the challenge of planning motions taking into account longer traffic predictions, and the possibility of them being wrong is tackled. Finally, the suitability of some of the proposed theoretical results is assessed in a more realistic setup, where the methods are applied to real data provided by our industrial partners. This dissertation provides new ideas and methods to address the complexity of motion planning in mixed traffic. Specifically, we tackle the problem through a versatile motion planning framework and a set of pragmatic model-based decision-making strategies, paving the way towards feasible, efficient, and more reliable solutions.</p>

              <p class="paper_abstract">In this work, we present a motion planning framework for automated vehicles to drive safely through intersections despite occlusions and the uncertain behavior of the surrounding vehicles. A context representation based on probably-free gaps is proposed as a means to provide, in occluded scenes, richer information to the motion planner compared to representations only based on observed objects. Our solution builds upon the path-velocity decomposition approach. Path planning is performed with state-of-the-art techniques, while a novel trajectory abstraction is used to reason about speed profiles without explicitly generating sequences of accelerations. A reachability-based analysis is as well formulated to efficiently identify the best safe speed profile for every path candidate.The proposed planning workflow is evaluated in roundabout scenarios. Our simulation study shows that the proposed context representation facilitates the decision-making in occluded scenes and that the reachability-based planning strategy is robust, computationally efficient, and outperforms a simpler reactive strategy.</p>

              <p class="paper_abstract">Merging efficiently into roundabouts represents a challenge for autonomous vehicles due to the speed difference between merging traffic flows and the lack of certainty regarding drivers' intent, specially when the road is shared with human drivers and/or inter-vehicle communication is not available. We propose herein a strategy to merge into roundabouts, which is based on characterizing the set of merging trajectories that are safe w.r.t. the traffic on the circulatory lane and reachable by the ego vehicle. Our solution leverages the belief that some vehicles in the roundabout will exit the intersection following a non-conflicting path, and generates efficient merging trajectories without compromising safety. Moreover, our decision-making policy is formulated at a high level and does not involve explicitly generating any trajectory, whereby the required computational time remains sufficiently low. In simulation, our strategy brings benefits not only to the smoothness of the merging trajectories themselves but also to the overall traffic performance, which improves 25% w.r.t. a simpler reactive merging approach.</p>

                This paper presents a distributed maneuver planner for connected automated vehicles (CAVs) built upon the idea of CAVs being able to explicitly share their intentions by creating virtual vehicles (VVs) on the targeted traffic stream. Specifically, this work focuses on the decision-making process concerning the merging maneuver at single-lane roundabouts, for which a traffic model is exploited to assess the suitability of potential merging gaps. An optimization-based trajectory planner is then used to generate collision-free, smooth trajectories to successfully perform the planned maneuver. The algorithm is tested in simulation and its performance is compared with a gap-acceptance-based driving policy. The results show the potential positive impact that the proposed VV-based interaction mechanism along with the traffic-model based cooperative maneuver planner could have on traffic coordination.

                This work presents a novel virtual vehicle based decentralized coordination framework for Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). We explore the idea of CAVs being capable of positioning virtual vehicles to share their intended maneuver as well as request cooperation. This framework has potential to inspire versatile solutions and provides an intuitive interface to interact with reactive and unconnected vehicles. In this context, a preliminary coordination policy is proposed and tested on a three-legged single-lane roundabout. Simulation results show that the presented solution performs outstandingly better when it leverages the freedom at positioning virtual vehicles that our framework provides. Furthermore, the performance degradation resulting from mixing CAVs and unconnected cars is observed, and coordination assessment under this circumstance is discussed.

                This article presents a distributed reactive-predictive scheme to coordinate autonomous vehicles at single lane roundabouts relying on shared information. Combining predictive and reactive control schemes allows dealing with potentially inconsistent priorities and behavioral uncertainties. A novel priority framework is addressed to allow vehicles to calculate relative priorities in a distributed way. The strategy is tested on simulation considering the coexistence of heterogeneous vehicles and observing the influence of traffic density on coordination performance.

                Electromobility promises to have a strong impact in several aspects of our life: introducing new means of transport concepts, proposing new business models and allowing to create new vehicle configurations impossible with traditional combustion engines. Regarding the latter, this paper presents a novel torque distribution strategy for a 4 in-wheel electric vehicle which aims to reduce the total longitudinal slip. The control strategy is designed off-line supported by a simulator and tested both in simulation (with a different model from the used for designing) as well as on a real sized prototype. The results show that the total longitudinal slip is successfully reduced after applying the control strategy and additionally, the radius described by the vehicle while cornering is slightly closer to the theoretical Ackerman radius.
